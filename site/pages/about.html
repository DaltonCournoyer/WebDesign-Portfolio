<!-- second up is about me. just talk about myself

hobbies: drawing, playing video games, a little bit of music on the side

use images and icons as Complementary tools. You got this.

keep the focus on PERSONAL stuff, not CAREER stuff.

i THINK this one can be relatively short but i'm not sure. probably good to have some filler stuff though.

make the words have more impact by spacing them out?
