<!-- The one page I actually know what to do on, CONTACT.

make a webform for contact information.

the instructions are rather forgettable and in depth, so check them OFTEN.

ENSURE. CORRECT. VALIDATION.
review previous assignments and see what i should AVOID and FIX in this one.

the form doesn't Actually have to work. just SEEM like it does.

what I need:
    - text inputs - placeholder + instant validation js
    - calender input - instant validation ONCE THEY CLICK A DATE. AND ALWAYS CHECK THE DATES.
    - checkboxes - multiple selections. i think this was covered well in the webform i already did, so use that.
    - radio buttons - meaning its NOT optional, so ensure correct validation.
    - textarea - additional comments, probably optional. Please don't validate this. Please. 

the assignment will probably want me to check with W3C guidelines and accessibility.
this means you should
    1. Emphasize - make it obvious. make it clear. make it shine like a sore spot.
    2. Dummyproof - check for every worst case scenario because you can no longer trust your own code. EVERY. CASE.
    3. Streamline - make it CLEAN. make it MINIMAL. this is DESIGN.
        also, don't add too many images. realistically, i'd only need one, for a background graphic.
    4. Triple Check - triple check the work. make sure it WORKS. make few mistakes. very few.

now, i've obviously DISTRACTED myself by reading this, so, again, a tl;dr
    - just redo what you did for the last webform but check for comments and make it BETTER.
    - add a bit more stuff too.

VALIDATION. VALIDATION. VALIDATION. ALL-->
