<!-- 


    This is to remind myself about how to APPROACH this project.


    Do not wait until the last day. You can skip games, you can't skip a career.


    I know it's going to be stressful.
    That's why you need to change how you approach this.

    



    Ignore the details.

    Use ChatGPT to make the base of this project, and slowly, SLOWLY, refine it.

    Don't feel guilty. Don't wallow in misery.
    Every moment spent like that wastes our time.

    Keep moving forward in the project.

    Just take it ONE STEP at a time.




    Remember what you've heard from others,
        about this project being
            24 hours?

                It can be done.
                It will be done.
                


                It won't be perfect.
                
                And that's okay.

    
    
    Don't focus too hard.

    Just flow through it and you'll find your pace.

    

    Whatever you can do to feel productive, do it.
    Whether it be planning or drawing out designs, do it.
    


    Sacrifices WILL be made.

    And your friends will forgive you.




    Keep moving forward.


    Always do something, no matter how little.


    Don't let AI write the ENTIRE project.
