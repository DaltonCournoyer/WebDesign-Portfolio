<!-- to-do: talk about 3 projects.

the first project - This one.

the second project - maybe one of the webforms I designed for class?

third project - make something up I guess

make a timeline in CSS - draw it out first 

use an html table/cards for organization on project details - also draw this out

use images and descriptions and provide links if the projects are deployed on their own server (probably not?)

include my github link to showcase my code repositories and whatnot

and nav bar. always include nav bar -->
