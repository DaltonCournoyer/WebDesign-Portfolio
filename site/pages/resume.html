<!-- the one page i probably would hate: resume

simple enough though
just divide the page into two columns, like a normal resume
look at the resume making thingies on google docs. yeah.
make it like that, but add some pizzazz. not too much though.

anyways, look again at the instructions if you feel lost.
i know i'll feel lost. i also don't have many good pictures.

maybe i don't need a good picture though.
a candid one could add a good personal touch...

Tangents Aside: include some personal links for social media (whatever ones I've got)

IMPORTANT: ADD A PRINT RESUME BUTTON. Consult stackoverflow and chatgpt on how this works.
FOLLOW-UP: the instructions say to use a CSS print style sheet to make sure it prints correctly.
you should look this up too.

now for the thick of it: what to Include?

Education. Work Experience (replace this with what i've done to help my family) and SKILLS.

include a variety of skills - hard skills AND soft skills. most importantly, soft skills. 

TIMELINE. add a timeline. VERY NECESSARY.

achievements are optional, so naturely, only brag to fill empty space on that page. stay humble, generally.

tl;dr for my poor future self...
    - split into columns
    - highlight education, skills, and work experience
    - add a timeline
    - short and sweet descriptions
    - review the instructions. ALWAYS.
    - DO NOT use chatgpt to FIX something, use it to make the BASELINE. fix it yourself.

    - calm down and relax. you can get through this.
